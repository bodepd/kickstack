1. Can we just use plain class parameters? Do we need to make hiera calls?

2. How do we handle password generation? Can we generate passwords and write them in hiera?

- no, I don't think this should be done ahead of time. Instead, there should just be a script that we
run that populates data into hiera

3. seems like there are a few data forwarding issues that need to be resolved:

- should I get some of the global data from the openstack class?
-- it makes life a bit easier
-- it requires a bit less code

- should I use hiera definitions to lookup shared data?
-- this will give me more power to do things like define how data maps to a single
value when



4. what is this thing?

kickstack, is intended to be a wrapper around the openstack module.

- makes data lookup easier
-- binds many class parameters to the same value (reducing the amount of configuration required by the end user)
- sets all required parameters
- limits the amount of configuration that needs to be thought about by default
- Assumes Puppet 3.x
- Assumes that users will use data bindings to set most configuration parameters through their explicit class interfaces






- if the results of getvar are not defined, the error message is TERRIBLE.
I should do some better error handling



- potentially add physical and volume group management back to iscsi backend...
